* Notes

** Cargo

   [[https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-03-hello-cargo.html][Hello cargo - using cargo]]
   
   Use cargo to manage projects:
   - ~cargo new <project-name>~ :: Create new project
   - ~cargo build [--release]~ :: Build project
   - ~cargo run~ :: (Build and) run project
   - ~cargo check~ :: Ensure the project builds (faster than build)


** Enums and variants

   [[https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html][Guessing game - enums and variants]]
   
   Rust often uses types named ~Results~, which are enumerations
   (enums): a type with a fixed set of values. Each value is called a
   variant.

   For ~Result~, variants are ~Ok~ and ~Err~.
